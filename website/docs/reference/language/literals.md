# Literals

- `null` and `undefined` (they are the same)
- `true`
- `false`
- Numbers such as `7` and `0.3`
- Character strings such as `"text"` and `'text'`
- Arrays such as `[1, 2, 3]`

Note that object literals such as `{ x: 3, y: 4 }` are not supported.
An object must be created by the `new` operator as an instance of a class.
